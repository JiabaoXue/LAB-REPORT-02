/* 

 The goal of this program is to make the buttonState value to 1 when PB is not pressed and its value to 0 when the PB is pressed while using the internal resistor in the Arduino (Input pullup). 

The main theme is: Digital Input

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset: 

void setup() { 

  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second: 

  Serial.begin(9600); 

  // make the pushbutton's pin an input: (tellin pin 2 as an INPUT) 

pinMode(pushButton, INPUT_PULLUP); 

//INTPUT_PULLUP = internal resistor so we don't need an external resistor. The internal resistor is 20K ohms.
